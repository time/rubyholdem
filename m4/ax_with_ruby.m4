# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_WITH_RUBY([VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND],[PATH])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Locates an installed Ruby binary, placing the result in the precious
#   variable $RUBY. Accepts a present $RUBY, then --with-ruby, and failing
#   that searches for ruby in the given path (which defaults to the system
#   path). If ruby is found, $RUBY is set to the full path of the binary; if
#   it is not found $RUBY is set to VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND if provided,
#   unchanged otherwise.
#
#   A typical use could be the following one:
#
#         AX_WITH_RUBY
