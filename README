RubyHoldem is a DLL for OpenHoldem that transfers requests to Ruby code.

To build it with Visual Studio 2005:
* Download RubyHoldem source code (with git or with the "Download" link on GitHub)
* Extract it somewhere if needed
* Download Ruby source code (for example ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.7-p72.tar.gz)
* Extract it inside rubyholdem directory
* Rename ruby's directory "ruby-1.8.XXX" to "ruby"
* Start Visual Studio 2005
* Select "Tools" / "Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt"
* Go to Ruby source directory
* Run win32\configure.bat
* Run nmake
* Now you should have msvcr80-ruby18-static.lib in the Ruby directory
* Open the RubyHoldem Visual Studio project
* Press F7
* Now you should have whuser.dll in the RubyHoldem directory

To use it:
You need a pokerbot.rb. You can get a sample in pokerbot_sample.rb.

The files rubyholdem.rb and pokerbot.rb must be in the "current directory" when the DLL is loaded.
Generally this means they must be in the same directory as the DLL.

All debug output and errors are written to rubyholdem.log, in the "current directory".

The file pokerbot.rb is reloaded automatically at each request if it has changed.
